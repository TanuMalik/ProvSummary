# ProvSummary
Summarization of provenance graphs

Code Code/ProvSummary.ipynb implements the algorithm and tests on datasets:
    ProvSummary is the interface for testing a small graph example in Code/testData/ 
    and ProvSummary_Swift is for testing swift data in Code/swiftData/

Also, the original graph and result summary graph of swift data are visualized as pdf files in Code/VisualOutput/

Ideas and previous presentations of the algorithm are included in Presentations/
